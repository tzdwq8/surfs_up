# Surfs Up Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide analytics on a weather dataset for the island of Oahu.  This is to determine the feasibility of opening a Surf n' Shake shop based on year-round weather conditions.  The dataset includes precipitation and temperature data collected from stations throughout the island.  Specifically, this project analyzes temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable.  The result will include statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. 

## Results
The summary statistics for the temperature data in Oahu:

### Month of June

### Month of December

### Analysis
- For the month of June there were 1700 observations recorded, while the month of December provided 1517 observations.  These are both a large number of observations which gives us confidence in relying on the statistics.
- The average temperature for June is 75 degrees, while the average temperature in December is 71 degrees.  This tells us the weather on Oahu is stable year-round and would not have an impact on sales.
- For June and December, the standard deviation is 3.26 and 3.75 respectively.  While ideally we would prefer the standard deviation under 3, this does seem to be at an acceptable level.  This is due to the minimum temperatures of June and December, which are 64 degrees and 56 degrees.  These temperatures are not cold enough in which the shop would have to suspend operations. 

## Summary
The temperature analysis for the island of Oahu confirms that it is an acceptable location to open the Surf n' Shake shop.  Having said that, additional data can be analyzed to ensure suitability.  Performing a query to understand the summary statistics of precipitation would be a next step to ensure rainfall would not be a factor in limiting business into the shop.  Also, performing a query to understand which stations are providing the most observations would be a useful exercise to help determine where on Oahu is the best location.
